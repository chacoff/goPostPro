# Introduction 

The goal of the software is to automatically post process the data from Dias Pyrosoft. Pyrosoft stored several plain data files containing 
information of the temperature of the sheet piles processed.

Our objective is to build a solution to automatically post process the data according the following restrictions: 

- the data has to be processed according the *cage* (according each camera also known as DUO)
- the data is link to a *montage* number. Because there is a config file link to each *montage*
